hero_image_alt: "I was freezing cold staying in the tent cabins in Half Dome (formerly Curry) Village in Yosemite Valley with my dad who was there for work, so I got up and drove around the valley at 6 am. Thereâ€™s been lots of fires in the area and the valley was filled with this thick smoke. Stopped at a turnout near Tunnel View and shot this photo - I really love the symmetry of it and the smooth gradients the smoke produces."
